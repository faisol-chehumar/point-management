This workspace is currently empty and ready for initial project setup.

## Recommended Structure Guidelines
When organizing the project, consider these patterns:

### General Principles
- Keep related files together
- Separate concerns clearly
- Use descriptive folder and file names
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### Common Patterns
```
/src or /lib          # Source code
/tests or /test       # Test files
/docs                 # Documentation
/config               # Configuration files
/scripts              # Build/utility scripts
/assets or /static    # Static resources
```

### File Naming Conventions
- Use consistent casing (camelCase, snake_case, or kebab-case)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Group related files with common prefixes when appropriate

### Code Organization
- One primary responsibility per file
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure code
- Consistent import/export patterns
