# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a complete SaaS member management system that handles user registration, admin approval workflows, credit-based access control, and automated daily credit deduction. The system will provide a modern web interface for both users and administrators, with automated processes to manage user access based on credit availability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration and Authentication

**User Story:** As a potential user, I want to register for an account and authenticate securely, so that I can access the SaaS platform services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a signup form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a user account with "pending" status
3. WHEN a user submits invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors
4. WHEN a registered user attempts to login THEN the system SHALL authenticate using email and password
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create a secure session and redirect to dashboard
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display error message and remain on login page
7. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL terminate the session and redirect to login page

### Requirement 2: User Credit Management and Access Control

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to see my remaining credits and understand my access status, so that I can monitor my account usage and plan accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current credit balance prominently
2. WHEN a user has credits greater than 0 THEN the system SHALL allow access to protected content
3. WHEN a user's credits reach 0 THEN the system SHALL immediately block access to protected content
4. WHEN a blocked user attempts to access protected content THEN the system SHALL redirect to a "no credits" page
5. WHEN a user's status is "pending" THEN the system SHALL display appropriate waiting message
6. WHEN a user's status is "rejected" THEN the system SHALL display rejection message and prevent login

### Requirement 3: Admin User Management Dashboard

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view and manage all registered users from a centralized dashboard, so that I can efficiently control user access and monitor system usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all users in a sortable table format
2. WHEN displaying users THEN the system SHALL show email, status, credits, registration date, and estimated expiry
3. WHEN an admin views pending users THEN the system SHALL provide approve/reject action buttons
4. WHEN an admin clicks approve THEN the system SHALL change user status to "approved" and allow credit assignment
5. WHEN an admin clicks reject THEN the system SHALL change user status to "rejected" and prevent login
6. WHEN an admin performs approval actions THEN the system SHALL show confirmation dialogs before executing
7. WHEN admin actions are completed THEN the system SHALL display success/error notifications

### Requirement 4: Admin Credit Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to add or subtract credits from user accounts, so that I can manage user access duration and handle billing adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin selects a user THEN the system SHALL provide options to add or subtract credits
2. WHEN an admin adds credits THEN the system SHALL update the user's credit balance immediately
3. WHEN an admin subtracts credits THEN the system SHALL update the user's credit balance and check access status
4. WHEN credit changes result in zero credits THEN the system SHALL automatically block user access
5. WHEN credit changes are made THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp and admin identifier
6. WHEN displaying credit management interface THEN the system SHALL show current balance and change history

### Requirement 5: Automated Daily Credit Deduction

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want credits to be automatically deducted daily from active users, so that the billing cycle operates without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system clock reaches midnight THEN the system SHALL execute daily credit deduction process
2. WHEN processing daily deductions THEN the system SHALL deduct 1 credit from all users with "approved" status
3. WHEN a user's credits reach 0 after deduction THEN the system SHALL change status to "blocked"
4. WHEN daily processing completes THEN the system SHALL log the number of users processed and any errors
5. WHEN the deduction process fails THEN the system SHALL retry and alert administrators
6. WHEN users are blocked due to zero credits THEN the system SHALL update their access immediately

### Requirement 6: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system owner, I want the application to be secure against common vulnerabilities, so that user data and system integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register or login THEN the system SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt
2. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate authentication tokens
3. WHEN admin routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL verify admin role permissions
4. WHEN form data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
5. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log actions for audit purposes
6. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want a modern, responsive interface that works well on all devices, so that I can efficiently manage my account from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL display a responsive design using Shadcn/ui components
2. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
3. WHEN actions are performed THEN the system SHALL show loading states and success/error notifications
4. WHEN data tables are shown THEN the system SHALL provide sorting and filtering capabilities
5. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability
6. WHEN users navigate the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy and intuitive flow
